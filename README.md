**Spotify Clone**
I developed a Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, accurately replicating the core functionalities and aesthetic appeal of the original Spotify platform. Key features of the project include:

Modern User Interface: A visually appealing and responsive design that closely resembles Spotify's clean and sleek interface, with a dark theme and fluid animations.

Music Player: Functional music controls, including play, pause, skip, and volume adjustment, to manage tracks seamlessly.

Dynamic Content: Integrated interactive elements that update dynamically, such as playlists, album covers, and song information.

Navigation System: A fully functional sidebar menu for easy navigation between Home, Search, and Library sections.

Search Functionality: A simulated search bar that filters songs or playlists, allowing users to explore content quickly.

Playlist & Album Pages: Detailed playlist and album views with track listings, album art, and playback controls.

JavaScript Interactivity: Utilized JavaScript to handle media playback, song transitions, animations, and user interactions, providing a realistic music experience.

Responsiveness: Ensured cross-device compatibility by using responsive design techniques, making the clone adaptable to different screen sizes.

This project highlights my ability to create sophisticated front-end designs and implement JavaScript functionalities for a seamless user experience.
